# ATS-Friendly Resume Builder WebApp
A simple web application that allows users to **create, preview, and download resume** in an **ATS-friendly** format. 
Built using Python and Flask, this project ensures your resume has the correct structure, grammar, and formatting to pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

ðŸš€ Problem Statement
> **"80% of resumes are rejected before a human ever sees them."**  
Companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes for structure, keywords, and readability. Most resumes fail due to:
- Poor formatting
- Inconsistent section placement
- Use of images or tables
- PDF content not machine-readable

This project solves this problem by generating **professional, grammatically correct, well-structured resumes** using only clean HTML and CSSâ€”no images, no weird fonts, no errorsâ€”ensuring **<80% + ATS compatibility**
